Password Generator Project

This project is a web-based password generator that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The user can choose the length of the password and select which types of characters to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters).

## Installation
To use the password generator, open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage
To generate a password, click the "Generate Password" button. You will be prompted to enter a length for the password (between 8 and 128 characters). Next, you will be asked which types of characters to include in the password. You must select at least one type of character.

Once you have made your selections, click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password that meets the criteria. The password will be displayed in the text area.


## Credits
The password generator was created by Andres Solorio as a project for UCR's Coding Bootcamp. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;as well as HTML source code from the assignment.
